<h1>Planning for Open Grants</h1>

Each year, researchers and practitioners across disciplines submit thousands of proposals for grants and fellowships. Each proposal represents hours of labor and contains details about research plans, collaborators, biblographies, and past work. To make the funding process more transparent and to share the valuable contents of these proposals, an increasing number of researchers are sharing their grant proposals openly. An open repository of funding proposals will elevate their recognition as scholarly products, improve access for the public and other grant seekers, and bring transparency to this facet of the research process. This site documents efforts toward this goal, including documentation of current planning activities and a prototype database.
