An increasing number of researchers are sharing their grant proposals
openly. They do this to bring transparency to research so that all stages of the process can benefit from better interaction and communication and to provide examples for early career researchers who are writing grants. This website provides a list of {{ numgrant }} of these proposals.

### Full grant proposal
The 2021 funding proposal granted by the Institute of Museum and Library Services summarizes past OGrants work and future planning through 2023.

### Tech stack

This site is built in Jekyll using the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme built on Poole.
It is developed on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Timeline

This site started in 2012 as a [blog post](https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/10/a-list-of-publicly-available-grant-proposals-in-the-biological-sciences/) on [Jabberwocky Ecology](https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/). In 2017 [Ethan White](http://ethanwhite.org) built the original version of the current site to make it easier for others to contribute and submit grants.

In 2021, the Institute of Museum and Library Services awarded the University of Florida a grant, under leadership of librarians Hao Ye and Perry Collins, to undertake planning for a long-term open grants repository, building from OGrants as well as efforts by Bess de Farber and Laurie Taylor to share library funding proposals. Website control was transferred to the [ogrants Github organization](https://github.com/ogrants) for further developments and maintenance.

### Acknowledgments

Development of this site is supported by the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/)'s [Data-Driven Discovery Initiation](https://www.moore.org/initiative-strategy-detail?initiativeId=data-driven-discovery) through [Grant GBMF4563](https://www.moore.org/grant-detail?grantId=GBMF4563) to Ethan White.

This project was made possible in part by the [Institute of Museum and Library Services Award # LG-250067-OLS-21](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-250067-ols-21) to Hao Ye and Perry Collins.
