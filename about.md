An increasing number of researchers are sharing their grant proposals
openly. They do this to bring transparency to research so that all stages of the process can benefit from better interaction and communication and to provide examples for early career researchers who are writing grants. This website provides a list of {{ numgrant }} of these proposals.

### Tech Stack

This site is built in Jekyll using the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme built on Poole.
It is developed on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Timeline

This site started in 2012 as a [blog post](https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/10/a-list-of-publicly-available-grant-proposals-in-the-biological-sciences/) on [Jabberwocky Ecology](https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/).

In 2017 [Ethan White](http://ethanwhite.org) built the original version of the current site to make it easier for others to contribute and submit grants.

In 2021 website control was transferred to the [ogrants Github organization](https://github.com/ogrants) for further developments and maintenance.
